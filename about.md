Hey! My name is William An and I am a recent graduate of University of 
California, San Diego (2017, Physics B.s.)
### More Information

This blog is for me to document my experience learning and playing with
various computer technologies and topics. I hope it will be of some use to 
anyone who happens to take a look!  

I am interested in pursuing a career in data science.

When I am not working on a computer, I like to surf and swim.
