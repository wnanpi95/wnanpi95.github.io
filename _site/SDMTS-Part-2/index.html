<h2 id="important-links">Important Links</h2>
<p>This post also has a supplemental R notebook. All of the code and the details
of the exploration can be found 
<a href="https://github.com/wnanpi95/SDMTS_DataAnalysis">there</a> in the Part_2 folder.
In this post I will only summarize the findings and display some highlights.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The purpose of this post for me was to confirm my beliefs on what I thought
the data values represented. For you, hopefully it will give you a better
idea of how the data is mapped out through out this file system. Admittedly,
my first exploration of this data set occurred before I knew anything about
any RDBMS’s, and as a result was pretty painful. Hopefully with my summaries
and the commands to put everything into postgresql makes everything crystal
clear.</p>

<h2 id="mapping-out-a-single-trip">Mapping out a single trip</h2>
<p>To start out, we’ll begin by mapping out a single trip. All of the code and 
details can be found in the R notebook. The 30 route has a special place in my
heart, allowing me to surf every morning at 6 before class. Let’s begin by
looking at a trip along this route!</p>

<p>The data we are going to need to plot this out are a trip_id, a list of 
stop_id’s and their coordinates, and a list of shape_pt’s and their 
coordinates. All of the data we need can be found in the shapes, stops,
stop_times, and trips files. After a bit of munging and using the ggmap api
we have the following map:</p>

<p><img src="route_30_trip.png" alt="alt text" title="Created with ggmap" /></p>

<p>The black line represents the path taken by the trip and the red dots are all
of the stops along the way.</p>

<h2 id="places">Places</h2>
<p>In the places file is a list of primary locations that are currently services by
SDMTS. Let us take a look at its distribution on a map:</p>

<p><img src="places.png" alt="alt text" title="Created with ggmap" /></p>

<p>The SDMTS system seems to extend out to cover a large region. However, there is
clearly a primary area of service, so let us take a closer look at that:</p>

<p><img src="places_primary.png" alt="alt text" title="Created with ggmap" /></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the amount of interesting things that can be accomplished with 
this data alone is pretty limited. However, the code in notebook should help
you get a more solid idea of how that static data is conveyed and how to
extract useful ideas out of it. Moreover, this data serves as a necessary
context for making sense out of the live feed data. In Part 3, I will cover
the process I am using to gather data from the real time feed.</p>
